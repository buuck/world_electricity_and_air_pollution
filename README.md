# World Electricity Usage and Deaths from Outdoor Air Pollution

Here I present an investigation into relationships between world electricity usage and composition and deaths from outdoor air pollution. This analysis is presented in the Jupyter notebook `world_electricity_and_air_pollution.ipynb`.

Data is from Our World In Data:
- [Energy data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy)
- [Air pollution data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor)
